# JDBC
JDBC or Java Database Connectivity is a low-level API that provides the ability to interact with relational databases.

# JPA
JPA or Java Persistence API (now Jakarta Persistence API) is an abstraction on top of JDBC that makes it easy to map Java objects to relational databases and vice versa.
JPA is a specification, the specification on its own is just a set of empty methods and a collection of interfaces that only describe Java persistence methodologies.
That means in order for it to be functional, JPA needs an implementation, also known as an instance provider.
There are several instance providers, Hibernate, EclipseLink, et cetera.

# ORM
ORM or Object Relational Mapping, like a bridge that connects Java and database.
Java objects can be mapped to database tables and tables can be mapped to objects. ORM is often delegated to external tools or frameworks like JPA.

# Hibernate
Hibernate is a framework that simplifies the use of relational databases in Java applications by presenting relational data as simple Java objects otherwise known as plain old Java objects or POJO.
Hibernate is referred to as an Object Relational Mapping tool or ORM as Java programmers were used to working with objects so Hibernate takes away the details of accessing the database and allows us to again work with something familiar such as objects.

# Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories.
This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers.

## Spring Data JPA Workflow
Assume that Hibernate is used as JPA provider and Spring Data JPA is used as JPA wrapper.

The basic flow for accessing the databases using Spring Data JPA is shown below.

![Basic flow of Spring Data JPA](/src/main/resources/static/img/dataaccess_jpa_basic_flow.png)
1. Call the method of Repository interface from Service. Entity object, Entity ID, etc. are passed as method invocation parameters. The entity passed can also be a primitive value.
2. Proxy class that dynamically implements Repository interface delegates processing to org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.support.SimpleJpaRepository and custom Repository class. The parameters specified by Service are passed.
3. Repository implementation class calls JPA APIs. Parameters specified by Service and parameters generated by Repository implementation class are passed.
4. Hibernate JPA reference implementation invokes operations in Hibernate core APIs. Parameters specified from Repository implementation class and parameters generated by Hibernate JPA reference implementation class are passed.
5. Hibernate Core APIs will generate SQL and bind values from the specified parameters and pass them to the JDBC driver. (The actual binding of values uses java.sql.PreparedStatement API)
6. The JDBC driver executes the SQL by sending the passed SQL and bind values to the database.

# Note
### JPA is not really necessary, because users can just use JDBC to communicate with the database?
As a higher-level abstraction, JPA maps Java objects in code to database tables and actually hides that complex SQL from users.
Users even don't need to know SQL or write any SQL code or depend on a DBA to help users retrieve data needed by users' Java applications.
JPA writes all the CRUD, create, read, update, and delete, operations for users behind the scenes.
So JPA is a huge time-saver and makes life so much easier as a developer.
